              <br />
              <p>
                Currently the two biggest limitations hampering the effective
                treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) are (1) a general lack of
                effective targeted therapies, and (2) a lack of predictive
                biomarkers to help oncologist identify which indivdual patients
                will benefit from either standard chemotherapy or the targeted
                therapies currently in development. This conference is targeted
                to basic and translational scientists working on CRC, as well as
                physicians who treat CRC. It is designed to capture the most
                up-to-date research on both the molecular working of the colon
                cancer cell and the clinical treatment of CRC, and present this
                information in a way so that knowledge from one discipline can
                inform the other. By doing so it is expected that both CRC
                scientists and clinicians will leave with increased insight and
                thus increase ability to perform their functions. It is also
                expected to increase research collaboration in the CRC
                community.

                that could potentially affect the information presented. MD
                Anderson also requires that all faculty disclose any unlabeled
