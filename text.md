## Goal

Currently the two biggest limitations hampering the effective treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) are (1) a general lack of effective targeted therapies, and (2) a lack of predictive biomarkers to help oncologist identify which indivdual patients will benefit from either standard chemotherapy or the targeted therapies currently in development. This conference is targeted to basic and translational scientists working on CRC, as well as physicians who treat CRC. It is designed to capture the most up-to-date research on both the molecular working of the colon cancer cell and the clinical treatment of CRC, and present this information in a way so that knowledge from one discipline can inform the other. By doing so it is expected that both CRC scientists and clinicians will leave with increased insight and thus increase ability to perform their functions. It is also expected to increase research collaboration in the CRC community.
